# Playing around with visualization tools
Phylogenetic Tree: PhyloTree.js
Protein Viewer: Molstar
Sequence Logos: Skylign

# TODO:
Add summarize feature which combines all outputs into a file.
Add more intuitive resizability to LogoDiv: try Interact.js 
Inherent issue with Skylign: fasta must be converted into a json object thru website. Cannot generate logos on the fly.
Phylotree doesn't give enough options for rendering. Play with manual tree implementation.
Clicking on node names does not allow collapsing of clades.
